I am currently a PhD student in the ELLIS program at the University of Edinburgh, supervised by [Siddharth Narayanaswamy](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/snaraya3/) and co-supervised by [Stephan Günnemann](https://www.professoren.tum.de/en/guennemann-stephan) from TU Münich.

My research focuses on advancing interpretability in Graph Neural Networks. At the moment, I am exploring GNNs that utilize graph kernels.

I have completed my master's studies in Mathematics and Computer Science at Jagiellonian University, where I collaborated with the Group of Machine Learning Research [GMUM](https://gmum.net/).

Outside of academia, I completed a few ML internships at Google and Amazon.
